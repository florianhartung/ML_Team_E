    "* Improve your understanding of the data \n",

    "        * \"clean_image\" contains the data after some some standard cleaning algorithms were applied. These data are used in the MAGIC analysis to derive the Hillas Parameters.\n",
    "        * \"hillas\" and \"stereo\" features are derived from the raw images by using the standard MAGIC analysis workflow. \n",
